## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS at-rules
- CSS flex shorthand property

### What I learned

A bit of semantics, I guess.
```html
<h1>
  Improve your front-end skills by building projects
</h1>
<p>
  Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
</p>
```
Probably wasn't necessary, but I'd assume it'd be quite handy when working on bigger projects in the future.
```css
:root {
  --clr-div: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --clr-body: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --clr-paragraph: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
  --clr-header: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```
Wasn't sure wether or not to use, but found out about this specific at-rule when looking up how to work with fonts and found it really neat.
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Outfit';
  src: url(font/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.woff2) format('woff2-variations');
  font-weight: 100 900;
}
```

### Continued development

Just a general improvement of the basics for now.

Focus more on HTML semantics in the future. Not only to help search engines and screen readers, but also myself - it's just so much more pleasent to look at than staring at 10 layers of divs.

Just learn more about CSS intricacies, its best practices.

### Useful resources
